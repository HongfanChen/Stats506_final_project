# Stats506_final_project
This is my final project for stats 506 Fall 2020.
This project focus on the following question:

**Do commercial buildings open 24 hours have larger average work forces than those that are not?  Does this depend on square footage category and principal activity of the building?**   

DATASET: 2012 US Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey([CBECS](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2012/index.php?view=microdata)) data. 

For more information about data, please click [documentation](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2012/pdf/user_guide_public_use_aug2016.pdf)
